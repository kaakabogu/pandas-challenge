And the passing reading rate of 85.80 is higher than passing math rate of 74.98 %, with the overall passing rate is 65.17%.

Bailey high school has the  maximum budget of 3,124,928.00 and Holden High school has the lowest budget of 248,087.00 its Holden High School. We can see later Bailey High School is not in the top performing schools. Regarding budget per student, Huang High School (655.000) has a higher budget per student, and Wilson High School (578.00) allocates a lower budget per student. Huang High School is one of the bottom performing school. The total district schools budget( 17,347,923.00) is higher than Charter schools budget (7,301,505.00), however, when we come to the total allocation of Budget Per Student charter schools allocation (4,796.00) is greater than district schools (4,505.00). This may due to charter schools have a smaller number of students.\n",

Pena High School has the maximum (83.839917) average math score (83.839917), percent of students passing math (94.59%) and average reading score (84.044699). it can be inferred that Pena High School might have a good quality, and reputation in teaching math, and reading; further investigation on the contributing factors are required to support the hypothesis. On the other side, Huang High School has a lower average math score (76.842711), and percent of students passing math (65.683922). Regarding the percent of passing reading class Thomas High School has a higher percentage value (97.30%). On the flip side, Rodriguez High School has a lower Average Reading Score(80.744686), and Ford High School has a lower passing reading. In the overall percentage passing Cabrera High School has the maximum passing percentage rate ( 91.33 %), and Rodriguez High School has a lower percentage of (52.98) passing.\n",

    "- School by school spending analysis does show inverse relationship between the spending range(per student) and overall grade scores for students in math and reading. The same inverse relationship is observed in the \"school by school sizes analysis\". The overall grade score for math and reading category decreases with increase in student size.\n",

    "- The data revealed that when the number of students sizes higher in schools the average math scores, average reading scores, passing math, passing reading, and overall passing decrease. So, we can infer that, when student size body increase, it negatively influences student achievement. Therefore, schools, cities, districts, and charters should work on student size in schools, and classes because it directly affects student achievement for so many reasons."
